# VS NOTES - Plus

Forked from <https://github.com/mafut/VSNotes-ToDo> on June 2025 and added various features.

"VS Notes Plus" is extended version of VS Notes + TODO. Original VS Notes is a simple tool that takes care of the creation and management of plain text notes and harnesses the power of VS Code via the Command Palette. The extended feature is for task tracking and seamlessly can check tasks across notes.
